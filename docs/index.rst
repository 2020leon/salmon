   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. A lot of this material should be in README.md too

Salmon - A Python Mail Server
=============================


Salmon is a pure Python mail server designed to create robust and complex mail
applications in the style of modern web frameworks. Salmon is designed to sit
behind a traditional mail server in the same way a web application sits behind
Apache or Nginx. It has all the features of a web application stack (templates,
routing, handlers, state machine) and plays well with other libraries, such as
Django and SQLAlchemy.

Salmon has been released uner the GNU GPLv3, as published by the FSF.
